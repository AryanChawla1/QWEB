<h1>Torus Puzzle Website</h1>

```algorithim.py```- can solve any square matrix of any dimensions. An idea of how the algorithim was thought of can be found under ```algorithim.pseudo```.

```rectangle.py``` and ```triangle_board.py``` created by Ronald Sun. They are variations to the common Torus Puzzle Board with different shapes, used in the daily puzzle.

For an understanding on how the game works, check out https://loopover.xyz.

<h2>Trying out algorithim.py</h2>

Replace ```solved``` with square matrix of your desire, and run program. Make sure to start at 1.
For any bugs, feel free to share!

<h2>Variations of Boards</h2>

For the variation boards, and its commands, use a number for the index of the row/column, 1 being the left-most row and top-most column.
Then, proceed with a direction: 'u' = up, 'd' = down, 'l' = left, 'r' = right. An example of a command is the following, '''3d'''.
When finished, type 'end'.
